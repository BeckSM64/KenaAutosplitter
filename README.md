# Kena Load Remover and Autosplitter
The ASL in this repository aim to remove load times for speedruns of the game Kena: Bridge of Spirits, as well as provide automatic splits for varying categories of the game. Both still need testing, use at your own risk.

# Load Remover
The load remover still needs testing, but seems to work. To try it yourself, follow these steps:
- Download the ```kenaLoadRemover.asl``` file (click the green code button then download zip)
- In LiveSplit, edit your layout and add a ```Scriptable Auto Splitter``` element
- Double click the element after you add it and set the script path to asl file you downloaded
- Set your Timer element to Game Time
- You may also want an extra Timer element that is set to Real Time to run concurrently with the Game Time Timer

# Autosplitter
The autosplitter is a work in progress. Right now, there is a file for autosplitting the Any% No PMI/VH category. The autosplitter currently assumes you have these splits:
- Sprout
- Dash
- Mask Maker
- Warrior
- Bow
- Hunter
- Toshi
- Meditate
